# ImageSpeak


ImageSpeak is a groundbreaking project that aims to assist visually challenged individuals in comprehending the content of images through the power of speech. It leverages a cutting-edge CNN-RNN model to generate descriptive captions for images. These captions are then seamlessly converted into natural-sounding speech using a robust text-to-speech library. By combining the strengths of computer vision and speech synthesis, ImageSpeak enables visually impaired individuals to gain a comprehensive understanding of the visual world around them.
## Problem statement : 
The ImageSpeak project is an innovative endeavor that focuses on developing a deep learning model capable of providing speech-based explanations for the content of images. This model utilizes a caption generation approach with an attention mechanism, specifically designed to work on the Flickr8K dataset. The primary objective of this project is to cater to the needs of visually impaired individuals, enabling them to comprehend the visual information contained within images using speech.

By employing a CNN-RNN architecture, the model effectively extracts and encodes image features using a CNN-based encoder. Subsequently, an RNN model decodes these features to generate descriptive captions. To enhance accessibility, the generated captions are seamlessly converted into speech using a reliable text-to-speech library.

This project represents a practical application of both Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, showcasing their potential in assisting individuals with visual impairments. The approach draws inspiration from the influential paper titled "Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention." To train and evaluate the model, the Flickr8K dataset is utilized. This dataset comprises sentence-based image descriptions, featuring a collection of 8,000 images, each accompanied by five different captions that provide detailed explanations of the image's key entities and events.
## Project Pipeline
The project pipeline can be briefly summarized in the following four steps:

- Data Understanding: Here, you need to load the data and understand the representation
- Data preprocessing: In this step, you will process both images & captions to the desired format.
- Train/Test Split: Combine both images & captions to create the train & test dataset.
- Model-Building: This is the stage where you will create your image captioning model by building Encoder , Attention & Decoder model
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using greedy search & BLEU score
