# ImageSpeak-
ImageSpeak is a groundbreaking project that aims to assist visually challenged individuals in comprehending the content of images through the power of speech. It leverages a cutting-edge CNN-RNN model to generate descriptive captions for images. 
These captions are then seamlessly converted into natural-sounding speech using a robust text-to-speech library. By combining the strengths of computer vision and speech synthesis, 
ImageSpeak enables visually impaired individuals to gain a comprehensive understanding of the visual world around them.
